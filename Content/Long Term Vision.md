# Long-Term Vision for Shinobi MUD

## Phase 1: Ninja Core Gameplay (Initial Launch)
### Features:
1. **Clans and Natural Releases**:
   - Players select a clan during character creation, providing unique abilities, affinities, and weaknesses.
   - Natural chakra releases (e.g., Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning, Wind) are central to combat and strategy.
   - Each clan grants:
     - **Proclivities**: Passive bonuses (e.g., higher chakra control, faster hand signs).
     - **Unique Jutsu**: Signature techniques that define playstyles.
   - Stance-based combat affects hitroll, damroll, and evasion.
2. **Training and Progression**:
   - Both **grindy** (manual repetition of actions) and **non-grindy** (quest-based or milestone-based) training paths.
   - Customizable stat growth through physical, mental, and chakra training.
3. **Grid-Based Combat**:
   - Players move in real-time across grid-based battlefields, emphasizing positioning.
   - Ranged and melee specialists thrive based on distance control and timing.
4. **Dynamic Combat Styles**:
   - Stances (Offensive, Defensive, Balanced) and styles interact with natural releases (rock-paper-scissors mechanic).
   - Counterplay emphasized (e.g., Fire > Wind but weak to Water).
